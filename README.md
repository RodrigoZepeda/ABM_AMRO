Activate the environment either from the terminal using [conda](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/index.html)

``
conda env create -f environment.yml
``

or with [Anaconda Navigator](https://docs.anaconda.com/free/navigator/tutorials/manage-environments/).

    - `patients`
    - `wards`
    - `Pfirst`
    - `Wfirst`
    - `activated`
- `NWard` (integer) Total number of wards
- `NPat` (integer) Total number of patients
- `NDays` (integer) Total number of days
- `WardSize` (string) ???
- `day0` (date) First date of measurement
- `daypos` (dataframe) Number of positives by each day. 
- `wardpos` (dataframe) Number of positives by each day and each ward. 

> :warning: Right now the data is extracted by `DataTransform.m` from the Matlab as not all the matlab structures were directly parsable from Python. Data is stored in `data_to_py`.
